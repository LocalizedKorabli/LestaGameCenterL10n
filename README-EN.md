## Q&A

### Why is it in Russian again?
Lesta Game Center itself updated the "lgc_res.dat" file. Reinstall the translation pack again.

### Some texts missing or not translated?
After Lesta Game Center updates, it may take a while for us to sort out the new text and release the new translation, so please keep an eye on the release page.
